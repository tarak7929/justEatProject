# Technical Questions

### How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

For Technical Test, I spent around 2 hours to complete the assigned tasks. If I had more time to spend for this technical test, then I would test more features as well.

### What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

There are some good trends in the Test Automation market. Those trends are

- Codeless Test Automation
- Artificial Intelligence
- Robotic Process Automation
- Blend of Agile and DevOps
- Adoption of IoT Testing

But, from these I think Codeless Test Automation is most interesting trend in Test Automation. In order to increase the scalability of test automation, ‘Codeless Test Automation’ is introduced. Codeless Test Automation tool facilitates the Software Testers and Business Users to automate test cases without thinking about the coding. It helps to deliver faster results and decreases the time consumed to understand the code.

### How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?

It is always an enormous task to write automated regression tests for a legacy application. The questions vary from where to start, how much to automate and deciding on the best strategy for automation. 
Before starting on automation for a legacy project, I suggest getting a big picture of the project to identify the specific areas which need attention. I recommended that for a legacy system, if there are manual tests, then usually those are scripted well enough to become low hanging fruit for automation. I also suggest test driven porting and for any legacy application, the most critical business scenarios should have automated regression tests if the porting must be successful. There is a little chance to automate the entire legacy application in one go. I would suggest following things to implement Test Automation in a Legacy Application.

- Ask the customers to prioritize the critical areas of the app
- Write manual regression test scripts for each area
- Budget time in each sprint to write GUI smoke tests for those areas
- Execute the test suite at least once a day with the CI framework
- All new development should have adequate tests

Thus, it might be a time-consuming affair to get the entire legacy application covered with automated regression tests. The suggested approach is to build enough coverage for the business-critical functionality and gradually build a harness around the system.

### How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?

I would suggest using cookies to improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website. With the use of cookies, when any customer login in the application from his/her device after certain amount of time, if the use is not active on the application user will automatically logout from his/her session. Due to this, customer privacy will secure from any device.
